# Intro

I am a Pre-Doc MS student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. [**Junchen Jiang**](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/). My research focuses on systems for large language models (LLMs) and computer networking. Previously, I was a visiting student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked closely with Dr. [Liangcheng Yu](https://liangchengyu.com/). I earned my B.E. in Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I am one of the core contributors of the following **open-source projects**:

- [LMCache](https://lmcache.ai/): The first open-source Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN) that accelerates LLM applications up to 8x faster, at 8x lower cost.
- [vLLM production stack](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack): Scale from single vLLM instance to distributed vLLM deployment without changing any application code.
- [LMBenchmark](https://github.com/LMCache/LMBenchmark): Systematic and comprehensive benchmarks for LLM systems.
