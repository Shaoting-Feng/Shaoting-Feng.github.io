# Intro

I am a Pre-Doc MS student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. [**Junchen Jiang**](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/). My research focuses on systems for large language models (LLMs) and computer networking. I am particularly interested in MLSys, which bridges the gap between rapidly developing machine learning algorithms and hardware. Previously, I was a visiting student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked closely with Dr. [Liangcheng Yu](https://liangchengyu.com/). I earned my B.E. in Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I am one of the core contributors and maintainers of the following **open-source projects**:

- [LMCache](https://lmcache.ai/) (Stars 5.4k): The first high-performance KV cache management layer for distributed LLM inference.
- [vLLM production stack](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/production-stack/en/latest/) (Stars 1.8k): vLLMâ€™s reference system for K8S-native cluster-wide deployment.
