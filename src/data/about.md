# Intro

I am a Pre-Doc MS student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. **[Junchen Jiang](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/)**. My research interests lie in systems for large language models (LLMs) and computer networking. Previously, I earned my B.S. in Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

&nbsp;

Iâ€™m currently maintaining the following **open-source projects**:

- [LMCache](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache): The first open-source Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN) that accelerates LLM applications up to 8x faster, at 8x lower cost.
- [vLLM production stack](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack): Scale from single vLLM instance to distributed vLLM deployment without changing any application code.

Additionally, I am a contributor to [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).
